Credit Risk Analysis Report

Analysis Overview: The purpose of this analysis was to create, train and evaluate a model based on credit-risk. The model outcome
was between 0 and 1. Being 0 considered a healthy loan and 1 a high-risk loan. The data considered took into account data
such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derrogatory accounts and total debt to finally
determine loan status. To train the models first I put the data into a dataframe and split the dataset into training and testing.
datasets.Then a logistic regression was made with sklearn and the training data was fit to the model. As the data was unbalanced, a second model
was created using randomOverSampler, this resampled data was then fit to the model and made predictions. In the end, second trained
model gave the most accurate results, with 99% Accuracy

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.

Trained Model 1:

Accuracy: 95%

Precision: Healthy Loans: 1.00
           High-Risk Loans: 0.85

Recall: Healthy Loans: 1.00
        High-Risk Loans: 0.89


Trained Model 2:

Accuracy: 99%

Precision: Healthy Loans: 1.00
           High-Risk Loans: 0.84

Recall: Healthy Loans: 0.99
        High-Risk Loans: 0.99

In summary:

Both Models are accurate in predicting healthy loans. However, Model 2 using resampled data has near perfect accuracy score. 
I would recommend for the user to go for trained model 2.
